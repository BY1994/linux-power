When a vdd is configured a regulator supply handle is acquired and stored in the corresponding vdd structure.The regulators scale/set voltage function is plugged in to the vdd's voltage scale function pointer. Thus when a voltage change is requested forwarded to a vdd. The voltage layer requests the regulator framework to change the device voltage to the target voltage. Regluator driver verifies if the target voltage is in with in the limits of the voltage domain and regulator supply constraints. If all the checks go through then regulator changes the voltage of the requested device to the target voltage.
